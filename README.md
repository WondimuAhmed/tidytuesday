# TidyTuesday Projects

Welcome to my #TidyTuesday repository — a curated collection of weekly data explorations, visualizations, and analytical workflows based on publicly available datasets from the TidyTuesday project.

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly initiative organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io) that promotes hands-on practice in data wrangling, visualization, and analytical storytelling using R, Python, and the broader data science toolkit. This repository serves as both a creative outlet and a technical journal for applying and refining reproducible workflows, exploratory data analysis techniques, and communication of insights through data.

# Through this repository, I aim to:
- Communicate insights through well-documented analyses and compelling data narratives.
- Engage with the broader data science community by sharing findings and visualizations across social platforms.

# Weekly Topics

Each week focuses on a new dataset. You’ll find one folder per week that includes:

- code : My analysis scripts in R or Python
- viz : Exported plots or graphics
- README.md: Summary of the week’s exploration


# Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io) for organizing this initiative and to all the contributors who make the weekly datasets available.
